                        Hi! I'm Ada, Countess of Lovelace and am an English mathematician
                        and writer, chiefly known for my work on Charles Babbage's
                        proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical
                        Engine.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I am one of the first to recognize that machines have applications
                        beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm
                        intended to be carried out by such a machine.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In my free time I like to read about scientific developments,
                        mathematics, and computational mathematics. I also like to take my
                        chances of winning big.
                      </p>
